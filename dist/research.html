            <p>
                I am currently in Dr. Paul <a href="https://pjcullen.wixsite.com/labsite">Cullen's Lab</a> at the
                University
                at Buffalo. I study the cell signaling network
                that regulates a fungal stress response known as filamentous growth in yeast. I try to understand
                molecular,
                ecological, and evolutionary aspects of the filamentous growth signaling network by using both
                laboratory
                and wild strains of yeast with wet lab and bioinformatic techniques. <span>[more details

                    <strong><em>S. cerevisiae </em></strong>
                    is a single celled fungus also known as baker's yeast. It has been associated with human culture and
                    domesticated for thousands of years for its use in
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fermentation">fermentation</a>,
                    a process used in making alcoholic beverages and baking. Biological
                    research has progressed in many areas because of this organism being a
                    powerful model to study genetics, cell biology, and molecular biology.

            <h1>Signaling Networks</h1>

            <p>Environments do not remain constant. Thus, organisms must respond to the environment in order to survive.
                Eukaryotes use <strong>signal transduction pathways</strong> to mediate cellular responses to the
                external
                environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                A signaling pathway is made up of multiple proteins or molecules that relay a message from an
                environmental
                stimulus. They can cause a direct response to a stimulus, or they can lead to a change in gene
                expression
                that will generate a response.
            </p>
            <p>
                Signaling pathways do not operate independently, however, because multiple pathways will cross regulate
                or
                affect each others activity, forming a complex <strong>signaling network</strong>. A signaling network
                is
                what regulates filamentous growth in yeast.

            <h1>Filamentous Growth</h1>

            <p><strong>Filamentous growth</strong> is a presumed scavenging response where yeast cells switch from round cell morphology to an
                elongated morphology under nutrient stress and produce filament-like structures. Filamentous growth
                occurs
                in
                many fungal species, and in pathogenic fungi, such as the human pathogen Candida albicans, it is
                critical
                for
                virulence, making filamentous growth an important aspect of fungal biology.
